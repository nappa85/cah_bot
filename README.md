# Cards Against Humanity Telegram bot

This is another CAH bot who tries to leverage inline mode to keep cards secret and always play in the same chat.

## Caveats

Inline mode doesn't pass informations about the chat where it's used, so a chat identifier is necessary to fill the gap.

This bot relies on Inline Feedbacks, so it's recommended to set it to 100% via BotFather.

## Packs

Packs can be retrieved from [JSON Against Humanity](https://www.crhallberg.com/cah/), use the full version.
